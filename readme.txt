== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What does the IDX Styler plugin do? =
The IDX Styler plugin adds CSS styles so that our themes work with a wide range of IDX providers. In many cases, it makes the IDX responsive, or adds other little touches to make your theme work best with your chosen IDX.

Sure, we could add this CSS directly to the theme, but you probably only use one of these IDX services. So we decided not to include bloat for all the various IDX services and only including the ones you need via this pluginâ€”ensuring your site loads as fast as possible
